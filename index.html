    <h2>Objective Statement</h2>
    <p>
        I am learning HTML skills as a retired backend developer. 
        Previously I was a professional Python and Go engineer working in a number of projects in Travel, Health Care and Engineering,
        developing back-end capabilities. Often using Python and Django, and also Go & Python communicating over gRPC.<br>
        <br>
        Now retired I am aiming towards developing a digital thread cutting 
        system for my lathe using Rust. In looking for Rust GUI tools, the best seem to be 
        HTML based, so I am learning HTML from the ground up. I am already  fairly fluent in 
        basic element use like lists and tables but my CSS and Graphics skills are low and
        my HTML knowledge is patchy.

        So I am studying the Udemy course <em>The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp
        </em> <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/37330378#overview">here</a>
